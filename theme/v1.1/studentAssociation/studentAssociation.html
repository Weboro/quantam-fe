    <p>
      The Quantum Institute of Higher Education (QIHE) Student Association is
      the formally recognised body representing the interests, needs, and
      welfare of all students. It provides a strong student voice in
      institutional decision-making and acts as a channel of communication
      between students, management, and governance bodies.

      Association, giving them the opportunity to participate in elections,
      attend meetings, and contribute to student-led initiatives. Through this
      engagement, the Association builds student belonging, strengthens
      community, and contributes to continuous improvement of the student
      learning experience.
